ANSWER
SELECT friend_name, count(resolution) AS resolution_count, 
SUM(is_completed), 
(SUM(is_completed) * 100 / COUNT(*)) AS success_percentage,
CASE 
WHEN (SUM(is_completed) * 100 / COUNT(*)) < 50 THEN 'Red'
WHEN (SUM(is_completed) * 100 / COUNT(*)) >= 50 AND 
     (SUM(is_completed) * 100 / COUNT(*)) <= 75 THEN 'Yellow'
WHEN (SUM(is_completed) * 100 / COUNT(*)) > 75 THEN 'Green'
END AS success_category
FROM resolutions
GROUP BY 1;
