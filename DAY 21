Today's Question:

Santa needs to optimize his sleigh for Christmas deliveries. Write a query to calculate the total weight of gifts for each recipient type (good or naughty) and determine what percentage of the total weight is allocated to each type. Include the recipient_type, total_weight, and weight_percentage in the result.

Table name: gifts

gift_id	gift_name	recipient_type	weight_kg
1	Toy Train	good	2.5
2	Lumps of Coal	naughty	1.5
3	Teddy Bear	good	1.2
4	Chocolate Bar	good	0.3
5	Board Game	naughty	1.8

ANSWER
WITH total_weights AS (
    SELECT 
        recipient_type, 
        SUM(weight_kg) AS total_weight
    FROM 
        gifts
    GROUP BY 
        recipient_type
),
grand_total AS (
    SELECT 
        SUM(total_weight) AS grand_total_weight
    FROM 
        total_weights
)
SELECT 
    t.recipient_type,
    t.total_weight,
    (t.total_weight / g.grand_total_weight * 100) AS weight_percentage
FROM 
    total_weights t
CROSS JOIN 
    grand_total g;
