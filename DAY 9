Today's Question:

A community is hosting a series of festive feasts, and they want to ensure a balanced menu. Write a query to identify the top 3 most calorie-dense dishes (calories per gram) served for each event. Include the dish_name, event_name, and the calculated calorie density in your results.

Table name: events

event_id	event_name
1	Christmas Eve Dinner
2	New Years Feast
3	Winter Solstice Potluck
Table name: menu

dish_id	dish_name	event_id	calories	weight_g
1	Roast Turkey	1	3500	5000
2	Chocolate Yule Log	1	2200	1000
3	Cheese Fondue	2	1500	800
4	Holiday Fruitcake	3	4000	1200
5	Honey Glazed Ham	2	2800	3500


ANSWER
SELECT dish_name, event_name, cal_gram
FROM
(SELECT menu.dish_name, ev.event_name, 
menu.calories/menu.weight_g AS cal_gram,
RANK () OVER(PARTITION BY event_name 
ORDER BY (calories/weight_g) DESC) AS rnk
FROM events as ev
JOIN menu 
on ev.event_id = menu.event_id) AS ranked_dishes
WHERE rnk <= 3
ORDER BY event_name, rnk;
